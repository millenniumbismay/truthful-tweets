Trump responded more generally, saying his own policies left things well enough at the border, and all Biden had to do \"was leave it alone.\" (We rated a similar claim Mostly False.)\n","Then he made a claim we wanted to check. \n","\"You know, the other thing that people don’t talk about — human trafficking and drugs,\" Trump said April 19. \"That’s doubled, tripled and quadrupled coming in, because that’s pouring in right now.\"\n","The claim was contained in an excerpt of Trump’s interview shared on Facebook by his son Don Trump Jr., who has 4.78 million followers on Facebook. \n","The younger Trump’s April 21 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n","The former president’s office did not reply to our request for information.\n","We found no evidence to back either part of his claim.\n","Human trafficking involves compelling a person into any form of labor through the threat of violence, fraud or coercion, and for the purpose of exploitation. Transporting people over a border is not the same as human trafficking.\n","Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, director of the Arizona State University Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention Research, said that from what she has observed, law enforcement agencies are not reporting increases in sex or labor trafficking victims and social service programs, are not reporting huge surges since Biden took office. \n","\n"," The final presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden grew heated when Trump criticized the Obama administration for detaining migrants in chain-link enclosures along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n","\"They built cages,\" Trump said. \"They used to say I built the cages ... And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him. They built cages.\"\n","Over the next few minutes, the president repeated the line, \"Who built the cages?\" four times. After the debate, the line inspired a slew of widely shared memes on Facebook.\n","\"Who built the cages, Joe?\" reads text over an image of President Barack Obama wearing a hard hat and posing in front of what appear to be migrants inside an enclosure. The post was published Oct. 23 by Dinesh D’Souza, a conservative political commentator.\n","The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Using CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool, we found hundreds of similar posts that have been shared thousands of times.\n","\n","(Screenshot from Facebook)\n","The Obama administration did hold immigrants in chain-link enclosures described as \"cages\" at border processing facilities. But the photo shared in the Facebook posts is not from his tenure. The image shows overcrowded migrant detention facilities in summer 2019 — during the Trump administration.\n","The image comes from a July 2019 Homeland Security Inspector General report on overcrowding at immigrant detention facilities in the Rio Grande Valley area of Texas. The report says the photo shows \"overcrowding of families observed by OIG on June 10, 2019,\" in McAllen, Texas.\n","\n"," Joe Biden claimed that a key difference between the administrations of Barack Obama and Donald Trump is that Obama didn’t \"lock people up in cages.\"\n","During the Sept. 12 Democratic presidential debate in Houston, Univision anchor and debate co-moderator asked Biden why Latinos should trust him given the millions of deportations under Obama’s presidency, when Biden served as vice president.\n","\"What Latinos should look at is, comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one,\" Biden said. \"We didn't lock people up in cages. We didn't separate families. We didn't do all of those things, number one.\"\n","We’ve noted that Obama did not have a policy to separate families arriving illegally at the border, and that separations under Trump happened systematically as a result of his administration’s policy to prosecute all adults crossing the border illegally.\n","But Biden mentioned \"cages,\" specifically, and reporting from the time he was vice president described an enclosure for migrant children with that word.\n","Controversial use of ‘cages’ description\n","The term \"cages\" has continuously been used by Democrats in attacks against Trump and the detention of immigrants arriving at the border. The Trump administration says that the facilities it uses are not cages.\n","The description has been used to refer to chain-link enclosures holding immigrants at border processing facilities during both the Obama and Trump administrations. \n","Notably, critics of Trump’s \"zero-tolerance\" policy that resulted in family separations circulated a photo that purportedly showed children face down on the floor behind a chain-link enclosure during Trump’s tenure. However, the photo was from 2014 when Obama was president.\n","Our fact-check showed the Associated Press photo was taken in 2014 at a Customs and Border Protection facility in Nogales, Ariz. The photo was used in an Arizona Republic article centered on an influx of children arriving at the border unaccompanied by a parent or guardian.\n","The Arizona Republic article, in part, said: \n","\"They are undocumented. They entered the country illegally. And when they were apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, they were shipped to Nogales from overwhelmed processing facilities in Texas.\n","\"But they are still children in cages, not gangsters, not delinquents. Just children, 900 of them, in a makeshift border-town processing center that is larger than a football field.\"\n","The article adds that the children are \"housed behind 18-foot-high chain-link fences topped with razor wire.\" \n","\n"," After the Trump administration in 2018 began separating children from their parents at the Mexico border and housing the children temporarily in chain-link enclosures, Democrats used \"kids in cages,\" a term the Trump administration rejected, to attack Trump.\n","Now, amid record-breaking numbers of child migrants crossing the border, critics of President Joe Biden are crying foul. \n","Stated one post circulating on Facebook: \n","\"Don’t hear y’all complaining about kids in cages now they’re at 700% capacity. Funny. Almost like you don’t care when it’s Biden.\"\n","The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n","News organizations including CNN and CBS reported in March that a temporary border processing facility holding migrant children in Donna, Texas, was at 700% or more of capacity. It’s a tent complex, essentially a building with soft walls, where children sleep in see-through plastic pods. \n","\n"," A couple of years ago, President Donald Trump accurately called out some Democrats for characterizing a photo of child migrants at a detention facility as a failure of the Trump administration when, in fact, the picture was taken in 2014, when Barack Obama was president. \n","But a Facebook post that claims another photo shows \"kids in cages\" in 2014 has its facts wrong. \n","The image shows children amid space blankets in what looks like a chain link cell. \n","\"‘Kids in cages’ taken in 2014 under the Obama admin,\" the post says. \"Did Michelle Obama care about the kids in cages then?\"\n","This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Currently, hemp is classified as marijuana under federal law and its cultivation is banned. However, historically, hemp has been used by Native American tribes for various products. The debate surrounding the legalization of hemp centers around concerns that it could be used to hide marijuana growing operations. In North Carolina, lawmakers are also considering regulations on the hemp industry to prevent this potential issue.\n","\n","\n","The Text is not truthful to the News Summary. \n","\n","In the News Summary, it is mentioned that hemp cultivation is currently banned under federal law and there are debates surrounding its legalization.

Experts rejected Trump’s false claim about COVID-19 deaths, stating that 1,000 deaths per day is not \"almost nothing.\" The U.S. has had over 229,000 COVID-19 deaths, the most in the world. Additionally, President Donald Trump claimed that recent American efforts to test widely for COVID-19 surpass those of other countries like South Korea; however, data suggests otherwise.\n","\n","Reasoning: The Text is truthful and faithful to the News Summary. Here's why:\n","\n","1. The Text mentions that US President Donald Trump said increased COVID-19 testing makes the US look bad by increasing case numbers. This aligns with the News Summary, which states that President Trump claimed recent American efforts to test widely for COVID-19 surpass those of other countries like South Korea.\n","\n","2. The Text expresses frustration with President Trump's statement about testing and asks why more deaths make the US look like. This reflects the News Summary, which highlights Donald Trump Jr.'s false claim that the number of coronavirus deaths had plummeted to \"almost nothing,\" dismissing the impact of the pandemic.\n","\n","3. The News Summary provides evidence from experts who reject Trump's false claim about COVID-19 deaths, stating that 1,000 deaths per day is not \"almost nothing.\" This supports the sentiment expressed in the Text about questioning what more deaths make the US look like.\n","\n","Overall, the Text accurately reflects and expands upon the information presented in the News Summary, making it truthful and faithful to it.\n","\n","True\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["content_list = list()\n","for tdx, row in test_data.iterrows():\n","  # print(row['cleaned_tweet'], row['top_5_news_summary'])\n","  content = \"\"\"\n","  Text: {}\n","  News Summary: {}\n","  Reasoning: {}\n","  \"\"\".format(row['cleaned_tweet'], row['top_5_news_summary'], row['generated_CoT'])\n","  content_list.append(content)\n","\n","print(len(content_list))\n","print(content_list[0])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"taT2O1OhQ5rf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701298513427,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Millennium Bismay","userId":"09399669580417612253"}},"outputId":"46037421-d242-4c21-ace1-47c0126f2d2f"},"execution_count":119,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["94\n","\n","  Text: Im literally laughing out loud at the biden speech keeps The unvaccinated like they are lepers The line about a missing relative at the dinner table He copied his own line from the debate with trump at least he plagiarized himself this time this sounds like an SNL skit\n","  News Summary: Facebook posts are circulating alleging that President Joe Biden plagiarized speeches from former President Donald Trump and made false claims about United Airlines' COVID-19 vaccine mandate. However, there is no evidence to support these allegations. Another post falsely claimed that Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor was seen dining with Democratic leaders when it was actually Schumer's wife. Additionally, a screenshot of a headline claiming Biden ordered the withholding of health benefits from unvaccinated veterans is fake news from a satirical website.\n","  Reasoning: The Text is not truthful and faithful to the News Summary. Here's why:\n","\n","1. The Text mentions that Biden plagiarized speeches from former President Donald Trump. However, the News Summary clearly states that there is no evidence to support these allegations. Therefore, the claim made in the Text is not supported by factual information.\n","\n","2. The Text also mentions a false claim about Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor dining with Democratic leaders. However, the News Summary clarifies that it was actually Schumer's wife who was seen dining with Democratic leaders. This shows that the information in the Text is incorrect and does not align with the facts presented in the News Summary.\n","\n","3. Lastly, the Text refers to a screenshot of a headline claiming Biden ordered the withholding of health benefits from unvaccinated veterans.
