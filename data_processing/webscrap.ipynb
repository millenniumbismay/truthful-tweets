Their backs are facing the baseball diamond, and the two are standing about 125 feet from home plate -- where a fellow Ray is taking batting practice.\n","\n","The teammate sprays a line drive directly at them. Instinctively, Longoria wheels around his head and torso, extends his right arm and catches the ball barehanded.\n","\n","The television reporter gasps, Longoria shakes off the pain in his hand and tosses the ball back toward the pitcher's mound. \"Keep it on the field,\" he says, nonchalantly.\n","\n","The :24-second clip was first posted on YouTube May 6, 2011 by MrSprts12 and has since been viewed more than 3.8 million times.\n","\n","The biggest question: Is the video real? Or is it fake?\n","\n","PolitiFact Florida decided to take a break from politics to put the now viral video -- and the Rays superstar third baseman -- to the Truth-O-Meter.\n","\n","At first glance, the catch seems improbable. And to baseball fans, maybe even impossible. But baseball players have made amazing barehanded grabs before. In 1989, then San Francisco Giants outfielder Kevin Mitchell snared a fly ball off the bat of St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Ozzie Smith with his bare right hand. And in 2005, New York Mets third baseman David Wright dove over his shoulder to catch a pop fly barehanded. Mitchell and Wright were in the middle of games, we should note, and saw the ball coming. Longoria had almost no time to react.\n","\n","Featured Fact-check\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Rick Scott\n","\n","\n","stated on October 31, 2023 in an X post\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Rainbow fentanyl is a threat to children on Halloween.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","By Sara Swann • October 31, 2023\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","We know several details about the video's origins, as explained by Longoria himself to the St. Petersburg Times' Marc Topkin and the Tampa Tribune's Roger Mooney.\n","\n","Longoria said the clip was filmed near the end of spring training, after Longoria spent nearly six hours filming a commercial for Gillette. Longoria said the video was shot at McKechnie Field in Bradenton, the spring home of the Pittsburgh Pirates. He claims it's authentic.\n","\n","The video -- \"It's still real, by the way,\" he said -- was shot with a handheld camera in one take in about five minutes, after the Gillette commercial wrapped.\n","\n","\"Unbelievable, huh?\" Longoria, a spokesman for Gillette who has filmed other ads, said. \"It's funny when you talk about things going viral; it really does once it gets on things like Twitter and YouTube. It goes from a small snowball to an avalanche quickly.\"\n","\n","Let's go back to the tape.\n","\n","Because there are several things that don't add up.\n","\n","In the video there are four Gillette logos visible -- two behind home plate and two on a roof facade over the third-base bleachers. But those logos aren't part of McKechnie Field in real life, Trevor Gooby, the Pirates' director of Florida operations, told a reporter for Patch.com. The logos were added digitally and included in the final video that was posted on YouTube.\n","\n","Next, there is the user who posted the video, MrSprts12. The user created his YouTube account May 4 and has only uploaded the Longoria video. The user lists his company as Gillette.\n","\n","Then there's the reporter and the video graphic identifying Longoria. There is no television station symbols or letters on the video, and the reporter is holding a microphone without a \"flag\" that identifies the station where the reporter works. Perhaps even stranger, we could not find the video posted on any news site. (Surely, a TV station would love to claim the video as theirs.)\n","\n","A strong circumstantial case that the video is doctored.\n","\n","But we wanted to keep looking. We asked Topkin -- who has covered baseball for the Times since 1987 -- what he thought of the video. From Detroit, where the Rays were playing the Detroit Tigers, Topkin said he believes it to be a well-crafted fake.\n","\n","Topkin noted several things that aren't typical during a batting practice session. There is no cage surrounding the batter to catch foul balls or stop pitches that aren't hit. There's also no screen protecting the batting practice pitcher. There are no coaches in the video hitting ground balls and no other fielders on the baseball diamond to track down any hits.\n","\n","And there's more. The batter, after hitting a ball right at Longoria and the reporter, isn't heard yelling for them to get out of the way. And though Longoria makes a miraculous catch, the batter returns immediately to his batting stance like nothing even happened.\n","\n","The cameraman doesn't warn the reporter or Longoria either.\n","\n","And  there's the frame-by-frame analysis of the video. If you watch closely enough, the ball is falling toward the ground as it approaches Longoria and the reporter. But in the last frame -- right before Longoria catches the ball -- it appears to move upward again.\n","\n","\"Simply put, once the ball has started into a downward trajectory, it cannot then again head upwards without an external﻿ force,\" wrote YouTube user meltingsmoke, one of several thousand people to comment or question on the video's authenticity. \"That clearly happens just before the ball is 'caught.' (It's) not the same ball and (its) trajectory is all wrong.\"\n","\n","The Times has been asking readers online if they thought the catch was real or fake. The vast majority, though not all, say it's a hoax.\n","\n","With the evidence overwhelmingly suggesting the video is a fake, we asked Gillette spokesman Michael Norton if the company would put the mystery to rest. \"The video was filmed while on location for a Gillette Fusion ProGlide commercial,\" Norton told us. \"We'll leave the 'is it real?' debate up to the viewers.\"\n","\n","At PolitiFact, we're ready to make the judgment call for you. From computer-added Gillette signage, to the reaction of the cameraman and the batter, from the way major league teams conduct batting practice, to the video evidence, this viral YouTube video is a clever piece of advertising. And fiction. Longoria is a good sport -- and spokesman for Gillette -- for saying the catch is real. But we're not buying it. We say Pants on Fire!\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","Article 2:\n","\n"," \n","With the new major league season under way, we thought we’d take a break from fact-checking trade wars and immigration disputes and turn our gaze toward greener pastures.\n","Our subject: A self-styled \"real fact\" printed on the underside of a Snapple bottle cap. The drink company puts hundreds of bits of trivia on its bottle caps on a rotating basis.\n","This bottle cap said, \"There are only 18 minutes of total action in an average baseball game.\" (As it happens, Snapple just inked a partnership with Major League Baseball.)\n","Is that right?\n","\n","Let’s acknowledge — ahem — right off the bat that not everyone agrees that this is an enlightening factoid.\n","\"I have seen such numbers attributed to various sports, including baseball, but I never delved further, as this seems a singularly stupid calculation, as if baseball in particular were a sport of more or less continuous action, like soccer or hockey or basketball,\" Major League Baseball’s official historian, John Thorn, told PolitiFact.\n","That said, the statistic appears to come from a study published by the Wall Street Journal in 2013. The author and study designer, Steve Moyer, had a long career in baseball statistics before his death on March 1.\n","Based on a sampling of three games that he painstakingly stopwatched and coded, Moyer found that, on average, \"a baseball fan will see 17 minutes and 58 seconds of action over the course of a three-hour game. This is roughly the equivalent of a TED Talk, a Broadway intermission or the missing section of the Watergate tapes.\"\n","That’s also more action than a similar Wall Street Journal study found for pro football in 2010 -- just 11 minutes. (Basketball, hockey and soccer don’t break down as easily into action and non-action segments.)\n","Moyer counted two types of action that together totaled 17 minutes and 58 seconds:\n","• Balls in play or runners advancing: five minutes, 47 seconds\n","• Other action (such as pitches, foul balls and pickoffs): 12 minutes, 11 seconds\n","In addition, Moyer broke down different types of inaction.\n","One was the time between batters (33 minutes, 39 seconds). This included \"knocking the weighted donut off the bat, announcing the batter, the walk-up song, cleaning the cleats,\" Moyer wrote. Another was the time between innings (42 minutes, 41 seconds).\n","But easily the biggest chunk of dead time was time between pitches (one hour, 14 minutes, 49 seconds).\n","This, Moyer explained, \"includes the unstrapping and re-strapping the batting gloves, sleeve adjusting, helmet adjusting, practice swings, plus the pitcher doing whatever it is he does as well. … Sometimes the pitcher will walk around or pick up the rosin bag, sometimes more than one sign will be necessary, sometimes the batter calls time and the whole process starts over.\"\n","\n","Because stopwatching an entire ballgame -- much less several of them -- is taxing, the experiment hasn’t been done very often, so it’s hard to know if the sample of games is skewed in some way.\n","\n","Featured Fact-check\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Stew Peters\n","\n","\n","stated on November 9, 2023 in a post on X\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","“Footage from Israeli helicopter shows the IDF killing many people at October 7 concert in Israel.”\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","By Madison Czopek • November 17, 2023\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","We found one additional study by Fox Sports that looked at a pair of major league games in 2010. Fox Sports found 14 minutes of action -- not precisely the same as what the Journal found, but an amount that was \"in the ballpark,\" Grant Brisbee, who writes on baseball for the sports site SB Nation, told PolitiFact. (Yes, Grant, we got the pun.)\n","We contacted Brisbee because he had taken his own look at a related question for SB Nation in 2017. Brisbee was trying to puzzle out the main reason why major league games have become so long in recent years.\n","Time has become an increasing issue for baseball, a sport that is famously not run according to a clock.\n","In recent years, major league games have run longer and longer. In 2017, the average length of games hit a full-season record of three hours, five minutes.\n","Using data from baseball-reference.com, we plotted out the inexorably lengthening duration of the average major league game, from a little over two hours right after World War II to a little over three hours today.\n","\n","As a result, time has become a serious concern at Major League Baseball headquarters. For 2018, officials instituted several new rules that were designed to speed up the game, including a limit on the number of visits that managers, coaches or players can visit the mound every nine innings, and changes designed to speed up video reviews of umpires’ calls.\n","Officials also kept in place rules that had been enacted in recent years, such as limits on when players can leave the batter’s box between pitches, and on how quickly pitchers have to get ready between innings. (A pitch clock -- now being used in some minor leagues -- was considered, but deferred.)\n","So, back to Brisbee’s question: Why are major league games getting longer?\n","To answer the question, he decided to stopwatch two games -- one from 1984 and one from 2014.\n","Going into the project, Brisbee figured that commercials -- primarily between-inning time -- would account for the longer game time. As it turned out, he did find an increase, but it wasn’t dramatic.\n","Instead, the culprit was the time between pitches, Brisbee found. He zeroed in on what he called \"inaction pitches\" -- balls, called strikes, or missed swinging strikes that didn’t result in the end of an at-bat or the advancement of a runner.\n","Brisbee found that 146 inaction pitches were thrown in the 1984 game, with 144 such pitches in the 2014 game -- an almost identical amount.\n","What wasn’t identical was the time those inaction pitches took up. In the 1984 game, inaction pitches accounted for 32 minutes and 47 seconds. In the 2014 game, they accounted for 57 minutes and 41 seconds. That’s nearly an 80 percent increase.\n","\"Pitchers don’t get rid of the ball like they used to,\" he wrote. \"Hitters aren’t expecting them to get rid of the ball like they used to. It adds a couple minutes to every half-inning, which adds close to a half-hour.\"\n","It’s worth noting that there is technically a rule to curb this — and there has been for more than a century. \"Since 1901, baseball has mandated that a pitcher must deliver the ball to a batter within 20 seconds after receiving it from the catcher,\" Moyer noted in his study.\n","But ask any baseball fan if they’ve ever seen that rule enforced and the answer will surely be no.\n","Of course, long games can have their charms\n","\"My perspective is that something is always happening in baseball even when the action on the field has come to a stop,\" said Thorn, the historian. \"Indeed it is the interstices between plays that to me are most valuable, as they permit conversation or reflection.\"\n","Our ruling\n","The Snapple cap said, \"There are only 18 minutes of total action in an average baseball game.\"\n","One credible study found just shy of 18 minutes of action, while another study was close, finding 14 minutes. That said, the number of stopwatched games is low due to the difficulty of the task -- only a half-dozen or so that we could find -- meaning that it’s hard to rule out a skewed statistical sample.

But we also think it's important to take the occasional detour. George Will, the syndicated columnist who's a regular roundtable member on ABC's This Week, gave us such an opportunity.\n","\n","To close out the show's roundtable segment on June 6, 2010, This Week host Jake Tapper brought up Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game on June 2, 2010, which fell apart when umpire Jim Joyce blew a call at first base. Joyce later acknowledged that he should have called the runner out, which would have cemented the perfect game, and baseball fans argued passionately over whether Commissioner Bud Selig should have overruled Joyce's call retroactively. (Selig decided to let the call, and the not-quite-perfect game, stand.)\n","\n","Will -- a bestselling author on baseball and one of the game's most prominent fans -- took Tapper's bait as if it were a hanging curve ball. Will argued that Joyce's incorrect call should stand, arguing, among other things, that the sterling sportsmanship displayed by Galarraga, Joyce and the other players after the mistake amounted to a far richer gift to the game and its fans than recording another perfect game.\n","\n","As evidence of how the sport can overcome bad calls, Will cited the final pitch of New York Yankees pitcher Don Larsen's legendary 1956 perfect game during the World Series -- the only one ever thrown in more than a century of World Series games. Will characterized umpire Babe Pinelli's call of a third strike on Brooklyn Dodgers pinch hitter Dale Mitchell as clearly incorrect, even suggesting that Pinelli rushed the game to a conclusion in order to preserve the perfect game. Yet Will concluded that baseball has survived quite nicely despite Pinelli's error.\n","\n","\"In the most important perfect game ever pitched -- 1956, Don Larsen in the World Series -- the 27th out was made by Dale Mitchell,\" Will said. \"A wonderful batter's eye he had. He struck out 119 times in 4,000 Major League at-bats. The umpire (Pinelli) -- it was his last game, by the way -- called strike three on Dale Mitchell. It was a foot and half probably high and outside. He was so eager to get the game over.\"\n","\n","A foot and a half outside the strike zone seemed to us like a pretty badly blown call. We thought it would be worth checking to see if Will was correct in how he described Pinelli's call.\n","Will would have been 15 at the time of the 1956 World Series, and we wondered if he had a seat behind the batter's box that day, or maybe watched the pitch on one of those primitive black-and-white televisions of the era. Had he reviewed a video of the game? We sought comment from the noted columnist, some explanation of how he would know so precisely the way the ball strayed from the strike zone, but he and his staff did not provide a comment.   \n","\n","Let's note that Will is correct about Mitchell's career statistics -- he struck out only 119 times in 3,984 at bats -- but did not mention that Mitchell was at the end of his career, with some baseball experts saying he'd lost a step. Mitchell's plate appearance against Larsen was the second-to-last of his career, and he batted just .204 (11-for-54) during the 1956 regular season and went hitless in four at-bats in the World Series.\n","\"This was not Dale Mitchell in his prime,\" said Gabriel Schechter, a research associate at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. \"I think it would be fair to say that his reflexes had slowed down, making it tougher for him to react to borderline pitches.\"\n","\n","We should also note that Will was not quite correct about this game being Pinelli's last. The perfect game was indeed Pinelli's last game behind home plate, but he finished out the rest of the World Series as a field umpire.\n","\n","Now for the big question: Was Larsen's final pitch really \"a foot and a half\" high and outside?\n","\n","First, we'll relate the case for Will.\n","\n","Lew Paper -- a Washington attorney who wrote the book \"Perfect: Don Larsen's Miraculous World Series Game and the Men Who Made It Happen\" -- told PolitiFact that \"every Yankee on the field who could see the last pitch to Mitchell, other than Larsen and (catcher Yogi) Berra, said that it was clearly outside the strike zone.\"\n","\n","In his book, Paper relates that Hall of Fame outfielder Mickey Mantle later said that he had \"a clear view from center field, and if I was under oath, I'd have to say that the pitch looked like it was outside.\" From third base, Andy Carey thought the pitch was \"high,\" while Yankees shortstop Gil McDougald said, \"It wasn't even close. It was high.\"\n","\n","Because these comments are consistent, and because they go against their teammate Larsen's interest, they carry some weight. In addition, Duke Snider, the Dodgers Hall of Fame outfielder, told Paper that in a conversation he had with Babe Pinelli years after the perfect game, the umpire said he'd wanted to go out with a perfect game and that any pitch close to the strike zone would be called a strike. If Snider reported Pinelli's quote accurately, then it's certainly possible to believe that the umpire may have bent the strike zone in this unusual situation.\n","\n","But none of this proves that Pinelli's call was as flagrantly out of the strike zone as Will suggests\n","\n","Indeed, most experts we interviewed agreed that the pitch was borderline. While most said it was likely outside the strike zone, we didn't find much support for the idea that Larsen's pitch was a foot and a half outside of it. Most said Pinelli's was a defensible judgment call -- which, if true, would reduce its value as a point of comparison for the Galarraga incident.\n","\n","Referring to the widely seen video clip of the final pitch, Steven Goldman, a contributing editor with Baseball Prospectus, describes the ball as \"tailing away\" from Mitchell -- enough that Berra had to \"lean pretty far outside\" to catch it. He said that Will's description was \"broadly accurate\" but also \"a bit hyperbolic.\"\n","\n","Featured Fact-check\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Donald Trump\n","\n","\n","stated on November 8, 2023 in a rally in Hialeah\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","“Just like the Cuban regime, the Biden administration is trying to put their political opponents in jail, shutting down free speech.”\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","By Maria Briceño • November 15, 2023\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","We watched that video over and over, and couldn't quite discern a ball on the screen. It was like watching mimes pretend to play baseball, but we're not the experts.   \n","\n","\"If it was not a strike, it was very close,\" said Doak Ewing, president of Rare Sportsfilms, which sells a DVD of the perfect game. \"It wasn't a foot and a half out of the strike zone.\"\n","\n","The strongest defense of Pinelli's decision to call strike three came from Schechter of the Hall of Fame.\n","\n","\"My view is that the pitch seemed a little high by today's standards, but not necessarily by 1956 standards, because the strike zone was technically larger back then,\" Schechter said. \"It also might've been outside, but lots of pitches that look outside aren't. I think the operative baseball maxim is that 'it was too close to take,' especially in a situation like that where a pitcher might get the benefit of the doubt.\" (For baseball novices, \"taking\" a pitch means not swinging because the batter expects the umpire to call it a ball.)\n","Schechter agreed with Goldman and Ewing that \"the pitch might have been out of the strike zone as we know it today, but not by a foot and a half.\" He added that anyone looking at the pitch today from the filmed version has to be careful about how they judge it. \"The camera angle we see is from above and to the first-base side, making it tougher to judge where the ball really was.\"\n","\n","We asked Alan M. Nathan -- an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) who has written widely about the physics of baseball -- what he thought of the camera angle and its value in judging Pinelli's call.\n","\n","\"Like many others, I have seen that video many times,\" Nathan said. \"The camera angle on the Larsen video is far from being ideal.\" Because the view is off-center, he said, it's subject to what physicists call parallax -- a difference in the apparent position of an object when viewed along two different lines of sight. \"There is a lot of parallax, making it difficult to know with any accuracy about whether the pitch was really outside.\"\n","\n","Nathan added that, judging by the film, \"the pitch looks outside. I can't easily tell that it is high, and I don't see how the others can tell that it is high. But I agree that it was too close a pitch to take with two strikes. Note that Mitchell himself started to swing at the pitch, but appeared to hold up in time.\"\n","\n","Larry Gerlach, the founder and former chairman of the umpires committee of the Society for American Baseball Research, agrees. \"Perfect game, last inning, two outs, two strikes: the batter damn well swing at anything close,\" said Gerlach, a history professor at the University of Utah. \"That is a cardinal tenet of umpiring — and batting. Pinelli made a great call, and Mitchell, by leaving the bat on his shoulder, did not do his job. You simply do not 'take' a pitch in that situation.\"\n","\n","So let's recap. There's ample evidence -- including the players' eyewitness testimony -- that the pitch was not a down-the-middle, obvious strike. In all likelihood, it was somewhat out of the strike zone. But we found wide agreement among our experts that Will is exaggerating when he says that Larsen's pitch was a foot and a half outside the strike zone. And if it wasn't a flagrantly bad call like Joyce's earlier this month, then the example's value for Will is reduced. As umpire, we rate Will's statement Half True.\n","\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","Article 4:\n","\n","\n","Some gun control critics are using a similar talking point in the national debate over this issue.\n","\n","PolitiFact Georgia spotted two recent claims on the topic that show the importance of being precise when making an argument on an issue.

For people who have to buy insurance on their own, the government adds new regulations for health insurance companies to follow. States will create \"exchanges,\" which are virtual marketplaces where people will be able to comparison shop for insurance. The law says that everyone must have insurance or pay a tax penalty. (That's called the individual mandate, and it's being challenged in federal courts.) People who make modest incomes will qualify for tax breaks to help them buy insurance, and very poor people will be eligible for Medicaid.\n","\n","What the law is not is a single-payer system, as in Canada, where the government picks up the bills; nor is it a nationalized system like Great Britain's where the government owns hospitals and employs doctors. So if those are the systems Cain had in mind, that's not what the new health care law is. (We asked Cain's campaign what the basis was for his statement, but we didn't hear back.)\n","\n","Even for people over age 65 in Medicare -- the part of the health care system that most resembles a single-payer plan -- private physicians would still make decisions about scans and treatments.\n","Still, opponents of the health care law have argued that it will eventually result in bureaucrats making decisions that affect treatment, particularly for Medicare recipients. But those claims have been rated False on our Truth-O-Meter when they have asserted that bureaucrats will make decisions about individual cases. \n","\n","For example, PolitiFact Georgia looked at a statement from Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., who said that under the health care law, \"a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy.\"\n","\n","Gingrey said the bureaucrats are part of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB.\n","\n","The board is a new part of the health care law, and it was created in response to criticism that Congress has been unable to make the politically risky and technically complex decisions needed to slow the growth of costs for Medicare.\n","\n","Under the health care law, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed certain targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow the increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendation within a set time frame, the IPAB's plans are automatically implemented. \n","\n","Both sides of the aisle have problems with the board. Some worry it will be too hard for Congress to overrule IPAB recommendations or that the board will stifle innovation. In recent months, several members of Congress from both parties have signed on to repeal the board.\n","\n","But saying that the IPAB will determine the course of treatment for individual cases is an entirely different matter -- and it's factually incorrect. Even people who oppose the IPAB agree that it will not intervene in the cases of individual patients but will rather determine how much the government pays health care providers for various services. It can also reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmission or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. (See PolitiFact Georgia's fact-check for more details on the IPAB.)\n","\n","But we should point out here that the IPAB applies to Medicare. Medicare is a government-run health insurance program for those over age 65. When Cain was diagnosed with cancer in March 2006, he would have been 60 -- too young for Medicare. So the IPAB wouldn't even have applied, even if it had been in effect at the time.\n","\n","We don't know the personal details of Cain's health status or how he is insured. But it's impossible for us to see how a government bureaucrat could have delayed Cain's care. Cain said at the debate that, \"If we had been on 'Obamacare' and a bureaucrat was trying to tell me when I could get that CAT scan, that would have delayed my treatment.\" But there is no part of the health care law that allows a government bureaucrat to weigh in on an individual's course of treatment -- not Cain's nor anyone else's.
